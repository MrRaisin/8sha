            <h1>About Cyprus</h1>
            <p>The Republic of Cyprus occupies the southern part of the island of Cyprus in the eastern Mediterranean.
			Known for beaches, it also has a rugged interior with wine regions.
			Coastal Paphos is famous for its archaeological sites relating to the cult of Cyprus, these include ruins of palaces, tombs and mosaic-tiled villas.</p>
			<p>In Cyprus you can go to many different historical landmarks that are full of Cypriot history like The Tomb of the Kings or The Kolossi castle. There
			are also load of important churches there like The Church Of Saint Lazarus, in Larnaca(where I was baptised as a baby) and the very famous Kykkos church way up in the Mountains.
			Cyprus in also famous for its lovely beaches and sun weather. For example you can go to The Coral Beach or you can just relax in one of the many villas 
			you can rent by the sea sunbathing or going in the pool.</p>
