Captain Cold (Leonard Snart) is a fictional supervillain appearing in American
 comic books published by DC Comics. Captain Cold is the leader of the Rogues, a loose

Leonard Snart was raised by an abusive father and took refuge with his grandfather,
 who worked in an ice truck. When his grandfather died, Snart grew tired of his father's
 abuse and set out to start a criminal career. Snart joined up with a group of small-time thieves and
 in planning out a robbery, each was issued a gun and a visor to protect their eyes against the flashes of gunfire.
