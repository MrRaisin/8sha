Mirror Master is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic
 books published by DC Comics. He is a recurring foe of the Flash with considerable

 the guise of Mirror Master (with a couple being members of the Rogues at different times). In 2009,
 Mirror Master was ranked as IGN's 79th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.
