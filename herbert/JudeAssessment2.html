As a young child, Rory was fascinated with fire, entranced by the flames
 as they danced and glowed. However, fascination quickly turned into obsession,
 and Rory set fire to his family's farmhouse...with them still inside, watching as the
 flames engulfed everything. As he grew older, his obsession grew stronger and he continued to set fires wherever he went.
</p>
<p>
After getting to know many of the other villains of Central City and seeing
 how they operated, Rory created a fireproof suit and handgun-size flamethrower capable
 of reaching extreme levels of heat.
