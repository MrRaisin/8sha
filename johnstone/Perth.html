   <h1>Perth</h1>
   <p>Perth is a city in Western Australia, it is on the coast of the Indian ocean and is home to animals
   such as kangaroos and kookaburras. It's very large and is a hive of industry. There aren't many things to do in Perth
 apart from the usual fairground and arcade but a big attraction is Adventure World just outside of the city.</p>
